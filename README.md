# A data-driven ordered list of Kanjis

When learning Japanese, Kanjis are, soon after knowing Katakanas and Hiragana, one of the main time-consuming tasks. Many resources exist to learn (to write, to recognize or both) thousands of Kanjis. However, as students may know and expect, the number of Kanjis to learn and the order of these Kanjis are crucial. The state of the art about this topic is rather old, and many student still rely on learning the Kyoiku Kanjis (1 026 kanjis learnt in school) and the Jōyō Kanjis (1 110 kanjis learnt in high school) with a quite popular method: Remembering the Kanji, a 1977 book by James Heisig.

With this project, I would like to suggest a new list, meeting contemporary quantitative methods and learning goals. Note that this project will eventually fuel a scientific paper.
